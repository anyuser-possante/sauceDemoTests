# sauceDemoTests

Sorry, I had to upload the project manually because my MacBook is facing an issue with the GitHub keychain that I couldn't resolve. 

Just download the project and open it in VS Code. 

After that, run `npm i` to install all the required packages. 

After this, run `npx cypress open` or simply `cypress open` in the terminal."

The tests should run automatically as you select the specs in the Cypress interface.
